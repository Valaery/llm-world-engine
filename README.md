This GitHub Pages site presents the complete LLM World Engine Knowledge Base extracted from the SillyTavern Discord community. Browse the full documentation with an interactive graph visualization, full-text search, and seamless wiki-link navigation.

## 📚 What You'll Find

The published knowledge base includes:

### **Production-Tested Prompts** (18 Templates)
- **Narration**: NDL-to-narrative translation, scene generation, action/dialogue/combat systems
- **Generation**: Character, location, and template meta-generation
- **Constraint**: Anti-hallucination (95%+ accuracy), format enforcement, length limiting
- **Retrieval**: HyDE query formulation (40-80% recall improvement)
- **Reasoning**: Chain-of-thought, binary classification
- All templates include real performance metrics, token counts, and testing checklists

### **Architectural Patterns** (18 Patterns)
- **Program-first architecture**: LLMs as narrators, not decision-makers
- **NDL Bridge Pattern**: Structured game actions → natural language
- **JIT Generation**: Just-in-time world building for scalability
- **Three-tier Persistence**: Permanent → Session → Temporary state management
- **Multi-model Routing**: Task-specific model selection for cost optimization
- Each pattern includes Mermaid diagrams, working code examples, and real-world trade-offs

### **NDL Language Specification** (17 Documents)
- Complete formal grammar (EBNF) for Natural Description Language
- 7 core constructs: `do()`, `search()`, `wait()`, `result()`, sequencing, manner, intention
- 100+ action catalog with examples
- 8-stage LLM pipeline integration guide
- Parser implementation patterns

### **ChatbotRPG Analysis** (18+ Documents)
- 89% validation accuracy: Discord discussions cross-referenced with source code
- 15 production prompts extracted from codebase
- 100+ code references with exact file:line locations
- 10 core data schemas + 8 sub-schemas
- 5 undocumented production techniques discovered

### **Community Insights**
- 24 months of discussions synthesized (Jan 2024 - Dec 2025)
- 15+ contributor profiles and expertise areas
- Evolution of NDL language and architectural thinking
- Lessons learned from ReallmCraft and ChatBot RPG projects

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Interactive Graph**: Visualize 102 interconnected documents
- **Full-Text Search**: Find specific prompts, patterns, or code examples instantly
- **Working Code Examples**: 125+ Python snippets with type hints
- **Mermaid Diagrams**: 49+ architecture and flow diagrams
- **Real Performance Metrics**: Token costs, accuracy rates, and optimization results
- **Production Validation**: Every technique backed by real project data

## 📖 Navigation Tips

- Start at the **Master Index** for a high-level overview
- Use the **Prompt Index** to find specific prompt templates
- Browse **Pattern Index** for architectural solutions
- Check **NDL Index** for language specification
- Explore **ChatbotRPG Index** for implementation validation
