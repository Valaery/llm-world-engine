## Critical Visual Assets

### Architecture Diagrams

#### LLM Processing Phases
**Creator**: [[User-veritasr]]
**Date**: February 2024
**Referenced In**: [[01-Architecture-and-Design]]

![[LLM_Processing_Phases-39904.png]]

**Description**: Comprehensive diagram showing the four phases of LLM processing in game engines:
- **Preprocessing**: User prompt intake and context preparation
- **Generation**: LLM produces narrative output
- **Post Processing**: Validation and formatting
- **Post Return Processing**: Response handling with feedback loop

**Significance**: Became the reference architecture for both ReallmCraft and ChatBot RPG, demonstrating the consensus around separating programmatic control from generative narration.

#### World Map Examples
**Date**: Throughout discussions
**Context**: Fantasy game world map reference

![[worldmap-3A4AD.jpg]]

**Description**: Fantasy-style world map showing continents, mountains, coastlines. Used in discussions about top-down vs bottom-up world generation approaches. Illustrates the scale and detail challenge in procedural world building.

#### Morrowind Dialogue System
**Date**: May 2024
**Referenced By**: [[User-appl2613]] (monkeyrithms)
**Referenced In**: [[02-Prompt-Engineering]]

**Context**: Shared to illustrate how LLM RP dialogue resembles Morrowind's keyword-based dialogue system. Discussion about how NPCs in LLM games tend to be encyclopedic like Morrowind NPCs rather than conversational like modern games.

![[2-Morrowind_2012-01-04_12-03-22-40-59818.jpg]]

**Quote**:
> "llm rp dialogue kind of reminds me a lot of the dialogue in Morrowind, which was all text, on a wiki-type keywords system, and there was this very encyclopedic way that NPCs talked"
